## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

This was my first time ever creating an iOS application! 
It was a really fun experience, I loved how I was able to complete this project completely fullstack.
The only challenging area that I encountered dealt with the customizing the style of the app and the I/O keyboard toggle.
For the background image, I had to take extra steps to place my desired image into this project 
and I was able to figure out how to scale the image so that it fit and showed on the iPhone simulator, 
there were a lot of background researching as to how to create a background, but 
I was able to excute my idea and I am very happy with my final result.

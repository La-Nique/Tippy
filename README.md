## Notes

This was my first time ever building an iOS application! <br>
It was a really fun experience. I loved how I was not only able to code the function of my application but I was also able to fully customize the design of the application as well as. I was able to take basic instructions on constructing the foundation of this application and turned it into something appealing.<br>
The only challenging area that I encountered dealt with the customizing the style of the app and the I/O keyboard toggle.<br>
For the background image, I had to take extra steps to place my desired image into this project. With research and experimentation, I was able to figure out how to scale my desired image so that it spanned within bounds and appeared beautifully on the iPhone simulator of Xcode. <br>
I was able to persist and execute my idea and I am very happy with my final result!
